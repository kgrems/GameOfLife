# GameOfLife
## Summary
I've always wanted to program Conway's Game of Life in some language.  I use C# at my 'day job' and it seemed like the right time to finally tackle the task.
## Platform
Developed in VisualStudio 2019 using C# and MonoGame.
## Instructions
Default is a randomly generated seed. Press the space bar to advance a frame.
## Future Plans
Have the thing run automatically.
